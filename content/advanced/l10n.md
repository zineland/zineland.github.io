Zine has some built-in copywriting, we use [fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) for our localizations. Here is the part of fluent file of zine.

```toml
view-more = View more
article-number = No. { $number }
previous = Previous:
next = Next:
author-article-title = Published { $number } article(s)
author-list = Authors list
author-article-count = { $number } articles
editor = Editor
```

Currently, we support **English** and **Chinese** by default. If your language isn't on our support list, feel free to translate those text and put it in your `locales` directory.

```diff
 .
 ├── content                     # the convention directory of markdown fiels of zine project
 │   ├── issue-1                 # the directory of an issue
 │   │   ├── article.md
 │   │   └── zine.toml           # the zine.toml of issue-1
+├── locales                     # the optional localization directory
+│   │   ├── your-locale.ftl     # the translation file, such as `fr.ftl`
 └── zine.toml
```

Also, don't forget to specify the default locale in the `[site]` section.

```toml
[site]
# the locale to localize your Zine site. default to "en".
# Zine has builtin supported locales, please check the `locales` directory of zine's repo.
locale = "fr"
```
