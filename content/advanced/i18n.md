Every zine website has a default locale which specified by `locale` field in `[site]` section of root `zine.toml`.

```toml
[site]
# the locale to localize your Zine site. default to "en".
# Zine has builtin supported locales, please check the `locales` directory of zine's repo.
locale = "en"
```

If you need add translation version for an article, you simple add `i18n.locale` to your `[[article]]` section, see below:

```toml
[[article]]
file = "1-first.md"
title = "First article"
# the translations of this artcle.
# the key of syntax is `i18n.[locale]`, the value is the article object.
i18n.fr = { file = "1-first-fr.md", title = "Premier article", pub_date = "2022-11-27" }
i18n.zh = { file = "1-first-zh.md", title = "第一篇文章", pub_date = "2022-11-27" }
```

Zine will render different translation articles and show a translation menu to switch between those articles.
