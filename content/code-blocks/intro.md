Zine provides some advanced code blocks to help you write articles.

The syntax of code blocks is straightforward:

~~~
```code-block-name [,option1: value1, ..., optionx: valuex]
the content of this code block
```
~~~

For example, the `urlpreview` code block:
~~~
```urlpreview
https://github.com
```
~~~

will render to this:

```urlpreview
https://github.com
```
